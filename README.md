### Description

There are two versions of the script. One script runs for minecraft and the other for roblox. Make sure you quickly move to the client when you the run the script or else the script will crash.

#### Roblox script

The roblox script does require some tweaking because the script relies on moving your mouse to the chatbox. This happens because the '/' key doesn't open the chatbox properly. This script clicks the chatbox to enter messages. Make sure the chatbox is open to use in game and coordinates are set properly accordingly to your screen. You can use the auto-pos.py script to find the coordinates of the chatbox on roblox to enter a message. The script will move around the chatbox to prevent the chatbox from disappearing.

##### Usage

* --help
* --x ; to set x coord of the screen for the rblx script.
* --y ; to set y coord of the screen for the rblx script.

#### Minecraft script

This script should work out of the box as long as you are on the minecraft client.
